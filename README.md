## Installing StoreCore

### Installation Quickstart Guide

1. Download the latest edition of the StoreCore files from the GitHub
   repository if you haven’t already.  Always download or fork the
   `master` branch for production purposes.

2. Create a new MySQL database for StoreCore on your web server.  Do not use
   the default MySQL `test` database or a database name with the `test_`
   prefix.

3. Add a MySQL user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying the
   StoreCore database.

4. Find the `config.ini` configuration file, then edit the file and add your
   database information in the `[Database]` section.

5. *Optional.*  If configured correctly, StoreCore is able to install the
   database by itself.  However, the installation MAY run faster and smoother
   if you install the database manually with a database administration tool
   like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or a MySQL command line interface.  First
   run the SQL file `core-mysql.sql` to create all tables; next run the
   `i18n-dml.sql` file to add all language pack data.  Both SQL files are
   located in the `/StoreCore/Database/` folder.

6. Upload the StoreCore files to the desired location on your web server.  This
   usually is a folder called `public_html` for a domain or `www` for a
   subdomain like `www.example.com`.  Do not upload the `/tests/` folder to a
   production server (or delete it afterwards): this folder contains PHP unit
   tests for development purposes.

7. Run the StoreCore installation by accessing the URL in a web browser.  If
   StoreCore was not previously installed, you will be guided through the
   necessary steps to complete the installation.

### Installation Logs

All installation and configuration activities are logged to `.log` text files
in the `/logs/` directory.  If the StoreCore installation fails for any reason,
please first check these log files for possible errors, warnings or other
critical messages.
